# Frog_Quest
A simple QT-Game made in QTCreator. 
This game features:
-Level loading
-a Low level physics enging
-Low level script timer
-low level animation controller
-level rendering

I mean, its a basic 2D game, what else is there to expect. 

If there is anything Id have to say. Just go use Unity or Unreal, you coud do what I did here in less than a day with any of those two. Its alot more fun too.
